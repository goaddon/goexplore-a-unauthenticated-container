# goexplore-a-unauthenticated-container

This repository deployes a generic container with a top menu and footer. The container can be shared between pages that does not require authentication. You can read more about it in [our docs](https://goaddon.com/en/addons/5bb227d283c3360abe01e036?tab=wiki#assign-a-shared-container-for-pages-that-does-not-require-authentication).
